## Starting project

To run the project, we have to take care of server's and client's site.

Inside "server" we need to install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

then we can run server:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Now we can move to "client" folder and basically do the same:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Client's site should be ready to start:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

After everything, React should open a browser with "localhost:3000". The server uses "localhost:1337".
